# Project Overview

This project contains three distinct tasks, each demonstrating different functionalities and concepts in web development.

## Task 1: BOM (Browser Object Model)

This task demonstrates a simple browser layout with a topbar and an iframe filling the entire space.

### How to Run

1. Open the `tasks/task1/index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. The page will display a topbar and an iframe below it.

## Task 2: Calculator Files

This task is a feature-rich calculator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports both basic and scientific modes, along with additional features like memory storage and a history panel.

### Features

- **Basic Mode**: Displays only essential arithmetic buttons.
- **Scientific Mode**: Includes advanced functions like trigonometry, square root, and more.
- **Memory Functions**: Store, recall, add, subtract, and clear memory values.
- **History Panel**: Displays the last 5 clicked buttons, which can be clicked to repeat actions.
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light themes.

### How to Run

1. Open the `tasks/task2/index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Use the calculator interface to perform calculations.

## Task 3: Canvas

This task demonstrates the use of the HTML5 Canvas API to create interactive or graphical content.

### How to Run

1. Open the `tasks/task3/index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Interact with the canvas to explore its features.

## Purpose

This project was completed entirely using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. The purpose of this project is to test the correctness and effectiveness of AI-generated work results after assigning different tasks to the AI.

## Project Structure

- `tasks/task1/`: Contains files for the BOM demonstration.
- `tasks/task2/`: Contains files for the calculator project.
- `tasks/task3/`: Contains files for the Canvas demonstration.
- `README.md`: Instructions for running the project.

## Results

### Task 1 Errors

1. **Initial Issue**: When the task was first assigned, it didn’t work.
   - **Attempts**: AI attempted to fix it 6 times.
   - **Persistent Issue**: The new open tab always opened in light theme (task15).

2. **Fullscreen Theme Error**: The fullscreen theme was always dark and did not match the original page theme.
   - **Attempts**: Multiple fixes were attempted (task19).
   - **Persistent Issue**: The problem remained unresolved.

3. **Highlight Range Error**: The highlight range was limited to the bar instead of the whole page.
   - **Attempts**: AI attempted to fix it (task20).
   - **Persistent Issue**: The issue was not successfully resolved.

### Task 2 Results

The calculator works smoothly without any issues. All features, including basic and scientific modes, memory functions, history panel, and theme toggling, function as expected.

### Task 3 Results

The Canvas project encountered issues and could not be completed successfully:

1. **Image Loading Error**: The project failed to load the picture correctly.
2. **Invalid Image Issue**: Even after inputting a valid PNG file, the image was deemed invalid and the project could not run correctly.

## Data Source

The tasks for the different projects were sourced from the [Web-Bench dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bytedance-research/Web-Bench/viewer/default/train?row=1).

## Future Work

I am still working on these projects and continuously testing AI-generated work. This project will be updated in the future as new developments or improvements are made.
